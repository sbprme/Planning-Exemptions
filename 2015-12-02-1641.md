Niall,

Thank you for this. I'm attaching below for your information an email that I sent earlier to Michael Walsh Chief Executive,, Waterford City and Co Council.

Regards,

Richard

>I refer to your e-mail of 27 November 2015 and to our subsequent telephone conversations. Clearly, both of us would wish that we were not in this difficult position. It might be helpful if I set out what the Department is trying to achieve and our views on the question of “change of use".
>
>As you know, in this instance, the Department of Justice and Equality is seeking to implement decisions of Government and provide full board hotel accommodation, with the normal related ancillary services that a hotel provides, in order to temporarily accommodate refugees under Ireland’s international obligations. Hotels are unique in being able to provide the full range of services that are needed for these purposes. Hostels most certainly cannot provide the range of services required by the State.
>
>We note the content of the Bord Pleanala decision. Without prejudice to the contents of that decision, can I stress that the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) have not signed any contract *with a hostel*. They have signed a contract with proprietors of a hotel in order for that hotel to provide the full range of services that a hotel would normally provide. The distinction being made between a hotel and hostel in the decision appears to be me to turn on its own facts.
>
>As you appreciate, it is always problematic to seek to apply a decision in one area, dealing with a particular set of facts, to a different area with a different set of facts. For example, one core difference in this case is that the people it is proposed to place in the hotel are refugees and not asylum seekers. This is an important legal distinction as programme refugees enjoy, in general, the same rights and entitlements as Irish citizens or EU nationals, including the right to work and to receive social welfare payments. Moreover, the length of stay of the refugees in the hotel is short term in nature and has no connection in any way to other services that may or may not be available in the area. In fact the location of this hotel is ideal in many respects for this cohort who need a period of calm, orientation and training before settling into new communities elsewhere in Ireland. Indeed, the use of such facilities to deal with refugees is strongly endorsed by the UNHCR.
>
>In my view the proposal to accommodate refugees in the hotel for a limited period of time is no different, for example, to a multi-national oil company block booking the hotel and putting off-shore workers in the hotel for some months or, perhaps, to the Council itself placing homeless families in the hotel for a period of time.
>
>To be clear, what RIA is doing on behalf of Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration (who have responsibility for refugee resettlement), is block booking accommodation for refugees in a hotel for a limited period of time. RIA is block booking the facilities of a hotel, a full service provider, so that the hotel can deliver the services that, uniquely, only a hotel can provide. These services include accommodation, catering, laundry services, conference and other related facilities.
>
>In the final analysis the argument as to change of use is one that you must take up in the first instance with the contractor concerned. I am sure you are aware that the issue of programme refugees is very high at present on the EU political agenda. The Department of Justice and Equality will be receiving further programme refugees in Ireland, following a lengthy process of selection and screening, in the coming weeks. Some of these are to be accommodated in the hotel concerned and if they cannot be accommodated the State would, in effect, be in default of its international obligations with all that such a situation would entail.
>
>I would like to provide whatever assistance I can in allowing you to arrive at a decision, which I entirely accept is for you alone to make. It is the view of the Department that the best course of action is to allow matters to proceed as planned and for refugees to be temporarily accommodated in the hotel. The Department does not see that the decision of An Bord Pleanala serves as a precedent in this situation as it relates to different circumstances and to a different cohort with different rights and entitlements.
>
>My strong recommendation is to let matters proceed for the reasons I have outlined above. Once people see what is involved and the suffering that the families concerned have endured, local opposition usually becomes local support.
>
>I am attaching for your information an answer to a Parliamentary Question which the Minister made yesterday which sets out in further detail what we are trying to achieve.
>
>Whatever you decide I would appreciate if you would keep me informed of developments.
>
>Please feel free to contact me as necessary to discuss this matter further.
>
>Kind regards

>Richard Ryan, Assistant Secretary
