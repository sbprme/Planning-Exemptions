Jim,

I think we need to draft a warning letter to the owners and for copy to the Refugee Integration Agency in respect of this. You might copy myself and Lar and we will take a look at it and decide on issue after a little bit of reflection to absolutely ensure we are correct. We are most likely to have to defend our position before the Bord and equally possibly in the Courts in this instance. 

The Act obviously prescribes that  where a representation in writing is made to a planning authority and it otherwise appears to the authority that unauthorised development may have been, is being or may be carried out and the authority shall issue a warning letter to the owner or to any other person who in its opinion may be concerned with the matters to which the letter relates as soon as maybe within 6 weeks.

In the circumstances we have solicitors letters and other correspondences that cannot be dismissed as vexatious and have formal announcement and press release regarding a contract between the RIA and the hotel for its use as a reception centre for refugees. We are therefore aware that unauthorised development may be taking place and the as soon as maybe needs to be influenced by the fact that the owner is patently making alterations at considerable expense and equally is inevitably discontinuing any sales, marketing or promotion of the hotel as in its current use, the combination of which may have disastrous financial consequences. We actually have a duty of care to all parties in this instance and in particular to the owner who is acting without knowledge of these issues.

Notwithstanding the obligation and indeed our desire to facilitate refugee reception and integration we have to act in accordance with our statutory obligations under the Planning Act and 1 would be clearly of the view that having regard to the previous decisions of An Bord Pleanala and in particular RL2685 the change of use is development and is not exempted development and therefore would be unauthorised. 

I cannot in fact see that An Bord could come to any different decision in respect of this case even though the circumstances are slightly different.

Its basic conclusions in RL2685 still apply

1.  The change of use of the first and second floors of the existing hotel to a
hostel accommodating refugees is considered material in the context of
Section 3 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 as amended, having
regard to the defined client group to be catered for and the length of stay of
the occupants,
2.  The said change of use does not fall within the scope of any one of the
classes of use specified in Part 4 of Schedule 2 of the said Regulations

and if we look at the logic or reasoning it certainly applies

The defined client group is certainly not that associated with a hotel which would ordinarily be tourists or business people or day visitors in and out of the hotel using the facilities. In fact all of these normal users will be excluded from use of the premises subsequent to the new use. The length of stay is certainly not of the norm for a hotel, being envisaged for clients as I understand it in most instances of the order of 6 to 8 weeks. Equally the duration of stay is not fixed but will be dependant on processing, assistance with integration and the provision of permanent housing elsewhere for the client group and certainly will not be under the control of the hotel. It will equally not be for a defined period and relatively short duration as is the norm in hotel use and in fact could be determined to be indefinite in that no fixed period can apply with any certainty.

I do not also believe that a refugee reception centre falls within the classes of use in Part 4 Schedule 2. I also believe that where we look at the reasoning in the Inspectors report that the lawful planning use is as a hotel as traditionally understood and I am particularly taken by the reference by the judge in the Lackagh Rock court case where the judge opined

> that in determining whether or not a present use was materially different from
> a use being made on the appointed day one must look at the matters which a
> planning authority would take into consideration if a planning application were
> made on both dates and if these matters were materially different then the
> nature of the present use must be equally materially different"

> â€œwhat should be looked at are the matters which the planning authority would
> take into account in the event of a planning application being made for the
> use on the appointed day or for the present use. If these matters are
> materially different, then the nature of the use must be equally materially
> different".

In the particular circumstances as apply in Clonea where the hotel is expressly permitted as a hotel in the normal sense and the zoning objective is "to provide for sustainable tourism uses including the provision of accommodation and tourism facilities" and where the "main uses would be hotels, marinas or other types of uses directed mainly at servicing tourists/holiday makers", we cannot view that the use proposed is not materially different. In fact it would be unlikely to have been permitted in the first instance and indeed in the future.

The Clonea situation is even more clear cut in my view having regard to the above as there might be some argument for difference with the Longford case around the nature of use and duration of stay but there is no argument that the proposed use is in conformity with the existing permitted use having regard to the historical and permitted use objectives for the area.

There is obviously recourse to the owner or any party to refer this matter to An Bord Pleanala. I must say as of now I am not minded to do so as I would be fairly clear that the proposed change of use is not exempt and would be extremely surprised were An Bord to find otherwise. The owner may chose otherwise, however, and would be within his/her rights but obviously needs to be informed. 

A warning notice would appear to be appropriate in this context.
