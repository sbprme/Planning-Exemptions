See question below being posed by Waterford, which in the light of a Bord Pleanala S5 reference, could be seen to be in the same category - ie it needs pp.

We need to check this out.

Barry, as you are on the Task Force, did this issue come up?

I have to say, I would have reservations from a planning perspective about use of the location mooted in Dungarvan.

CE there is pondering a warning notice re works that could be interpreted as unauthorised.

Barry, we might discuss on the way over to the meeting later.
