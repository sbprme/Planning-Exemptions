Michael, Lar,

With reference to the proposed / alleged change of the Clonea Strand Hotel to Refugee Centre the above, attachment is a S5 reference to ABP indicates that the change is not an exempted development. On that basis an application for the change of use would be required. We have had reports that work is on-going at the Hotel, getting it ready for Dept inspection for the use. I had the site inspected and we are advised by the owner that while work is being carried out, it is internal works to update fire alarms in bedrooms, including improving fireresistance to partition walls, etc. This type of work does not require permission.

Should the Dept. consider the Hotel as suitable for the purpose, the following issues arise:

1.  The Dept, by Ministerial Order, may declare the Hotel to be a Refugee Centre? If so then there probably will not be any further Planning debate.

2.  Is there a mechanism under the Ministerial Process above for public consultation?? I understand "Mosney" Co Meath was declared a Refugee Centre back in 2000, but I do not have any information on the process of declaring Ministerial Order? . Possibly this should be followed up by Corporate Affairs through the Dept Justice & Law Reform.

3.  If a Planning Application is required the following issues are raised:

    *  Whether a planning application can be made? - Zoning policy / compatibility with zoning / public observations & submissions / Variation of Plan / Material Contravention process/ adequacy of services / appeal to ABP /judicial review, etc. will all come into play. This could be a lengthy process and may require another intervention such as at Point 1 above

    *  Is the Clonea Strand Hotel the optimum location as a Refugee centre. Issues of access to transport, access to basic services such as health, leisure, shops, schools,social, religious, legal, safety & policing, etc will come into play. It will be argued that a Town location (within reasonable walking distance of services) is the optimum location.

    *  There is the debate of the effects on the Tourism Product - the loss of vital tourist (hotel) accommodation and the spin off for other complementary uses (camping, tourist shop, restaurant/food, etc at the Clonea location and further afield will haveto be appraised from the viewpoint of economic gain/ loss. SE Tourism /Irish Tourism Board/ WCCC Economic Section should be consulted on such matters.

Regards,

Jim
