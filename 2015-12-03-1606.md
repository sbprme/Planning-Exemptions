Subject: <b>FW: Clonea Strand Hotel ~ for attention of Reception and Integration Agency</b></tt></pre>Richard,

I attach herewith a copy of warning letters and explanatory letter issued on proprietors/manager of Clonea Strand Hotel yesterday, l would appreciate it if you forward them to Eugene Banks in the RIA as an involved party.

I am sorry that this Council has had to do this but having examined the matter in some detail I am satisfied that we have no choice.

It has been made perfectly clear to me that this matter would have been tested by way of an application for an interlocutory injunction in the event of our failure to act and may well be in any case. I could not myself or indeed ask any staff to go before a court upholding a position that we did not believe to be the case.

We have only had regard to Bord Pleanala decisions on such matters and case law in our decisions and are satisfied that our position now is defensible and that not to act under the planning acts would not be defensible. The RIA may of course make submission in respect of the warning notices and we will have due regard in any further decision we will make.

With reference to your email of yesterday I would emphasise that
• The cohort of residents has had no bearing on our decision rather it is nature of use when compared to that permitted.
• We have never suggested that it was a hostel and have merely referenced the reasoning used in the Bord decision and case law to form our view.
• We fully understand the difficulties for yourselves and the urgent need to provide facilities
• The analogy you use in respect of block booking by an oil company would also probably require planning permission
• Our primary issue is that the users are not holidaymakers or tourists that come and go both in terms of duration of stay and even within any given day and that the hotel will not generally be available for public use in respect of all of its facilities. As a consequence in law this represents a material change of use and therefore requires planning permission.

Michael Walsh,
Chief Executive.
