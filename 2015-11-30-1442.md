We had a look at the Board's Section 5 reference (RL.2685).

Subject to alternate and definitive legal advices, there would seem to be more than a respectable argument that, ordinarily speaking, planning permission is required for a change of use of a business premises from use as a hotel to use as a hostel (irrespective of whether any works are carried out).

Useful to reflect on the Planning Inspector's Report which sets out what are considered to be the key differences, in planning terms, between 'hotel' and 'hostel' uses as follows:

>"The Planning and Development Act does not specifically define or set out the distinguishing characteristics between a 'hotel' or 'hostel'. However it is considered that key characteristics that would help distinguish between both uses are as follows:
>
>*  The length of occupancy - a hostel is usually occupied on a medium or long term basis as opposed to a short-term basis associated with a hotel,
>*  A hostel generally caters for a defined client group/identifiable group of people for example, the homeless, tourists or refugees as is the case in this instance.
*  Accommodation in hostels generally includes some shared facilities.

It could therefore set out that not all hostels are the same in that the identifiable group of people they cater for will give rise to differing requirements of accommodation, communal facilities and additional services offered. Furthermore, the group of people that the hostel caters for can also affect the demand for local services/facilities in the immediate area in which the hostel is located and would therefore in my opinion give rise to material planning considerations that distinguish between 'hotel' and 'hostel'  applications".

The Planning Inspector continues by setting out the relevant references to those separate use classes in the Planning Regulations as follows:

"While there is no definition of a hotel or a hostel in the Planning and Development Act or Regulations, the definition of a "business premises" makes specific reference to including a hotel and more specifically to not including an "excluded premises". The definition of an "excluded premises" provided for within Article 5 of the Planning and Development Regulations, 2001 specifically mentions a 'hostel'. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that both uses constitute different classes of use. This is further strengthened in the Classes of Use contained within Part 4 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 where Class 6 specifically includes a hostel. There is no class that provides fora hotel use and as such there is no mechanism by which one could argue that the change of use from a hotel to a hostel is exempted development".

The Board agreed with the Inspector's recommendation that change of use of the first and second floors of a hotel to a hostel to accommodate refugees is a material change of use that is development. The Board particularly focussed on the materiality of the change of use having regard to the defined client group to be catered for and the length of stay of the occupants.

Taking the line above into account, WCCC would seem to have an argument in favour of their intended course of action.

Nevertheless, in the light of wider implications, it would be helpful to get a sense of your legal advices and position and we would be happy to discuss.
