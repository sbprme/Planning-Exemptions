Gentlemen,

I am seriously concerned that there has been no consultation with this Council as to the suitability of this site in a planning context for the purpose intended and l would have only heard early in the week by rumour of the proposition and in correspondence from others yesterday. Obviously the correspondence attached issued today is a form of formal confirmation but isn't even addressed to us and the lack of consultation is damaging, compromises our credibility in dealing with this issue and doesn't augur well for the overall programme for the future, where collective action and responsibility will be so necessary.

I would have serious concerns about the location chosen from a planning and development context and that from the attached letter there appears to be a contract signed in respect of it. These concerns relate primarily to the specific use zoning relating to this area, the contradiction to our overall investment strategy in tourism and the lack of services in the area.

I will be happy to reference these concerns separately but for the moment I have a more pressing issue on the matter on which I
would seek your advice.

I have attached herewith copies of an An Bord Pleanala decision relating to Longford on the use of the upper floors of a hotel as a hostel for refugees and the determination that the change was not exempted development and required planning permission. 

I am absolutely satisfied that any reasonable interpretation of the Bord decision would suggest that, while it specifically refers to a change of use from hotel to hostel, the reasoning used could only lead to a conclusion that a change from hotel to reception centre also requires planning permission (particularly where the zoning use is so prescriptive) and that I could now be statutorily obliged to serve warning notices and if necessary enforcement proceedings under the Planning Acts in respect of the development and that indeed both the hotel and the RIA could be notice parties to this.

I am under the severest pressure in this regard having already legal correspondence on my desk requesting me to so act and pressure from politicians of all parties.

Patently I have no wish to be in this position given the responsibilities we all have in this area and I am hoping that I am missing something and I am sure that the Department and the RIA have had due regard to the planning issues in this context.

I am, in fact, presuming that there are emergency powers or legislative provisions, that I am not aware of, being retied on in respect of this decision that will absolve the normal planning requirements and I would greatly appreciate it if you could advise me as to what these powers or provisions are and equally that they have been executed, so that I may discontinue the enforcement file now opened and reply to the legal correspondence and those making representations.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could give me reply by return. The hotel/developer are currently making alterations that may or may not be exempt and we need to make a determination.

Michael Walsh,
Chief Executive.
